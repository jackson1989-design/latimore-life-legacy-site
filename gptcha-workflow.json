Create a concise BRAND_GUIDE for internal use with the following sections:\n   - Voice & tone (3–5 bullet points)\n   - Core promise in one sentence\n   - Short “About {brand_name}” paragraph (3–5 sentences)\n   - 3–4 preferred call-to-action lines using the brand’s natural voice\n\n2. Make the language:\n   - Friendly, clear, and down-to-earth\n   - Respectful and never fear-based\n   - Educational only (no legal or tax advice)\n   - Appropriate for families and professionals in {service_area}\n\n3. At the end, output a compact bullet list called “Brand Guardrails” with do’s and don’ts for future messages.\n\nDo not generate any client-specific messaging yet.

Identify 3 main “Risk & Opportunity Themes” that matter most to this family, written in plain language.\n\n3. In a final section labeled “Structured Summary for Next Steps”, rewrite the situation in 1 short paragraph that another advisor on the team could instantly understand.\n\nKeep tone empathetic and neutral.

For each selected strategy, provide:\n   - A simple name you would say out loud to a non-expert\n   - One-sentence explanation in everyday language\n   - How it connects to one of the client’s goals or concerns\n   - A gentle benefit statement that is balanced and does not over-promise\n\n2. Create a section called “How I’d Explain This at the Kitchen Table” where you:\n   - Draft a short, conversational script (8–12 sentences total) that walks the client through the selected strategies in a logical order\n   - Use plain examples (mortgage, kids’ college, paycheck protection, retirement income, etc.)\n   - Reinforce the idea of preparedness, not fear\n\n3. End with a short list titled “Questions to Ask {client_name} Next Time” with 5–7 questions that help deepen understanding without sounding salesy.\n\nAvoid specific product names or carriers unless they were explicitly referenced in the inputs.

Weave in the theme of preparedness rather than fear, echoing the brand’s protection-first philosophy, without retelling the full founder story unless it feels natural.\n\n3. Add a closing section that:\n   - Repeats the main call to action (for example, scheduling another call or sharing documents) with {call_to_action_primary} and {booking_link} or {quote_link} as appropriate\n   - Provides a lighter secondary option using {call_to_action_secondary}\n\n4.

Add a short “Balanced Language Check” section where you:\n   - Call out any phrases that might sound too absolute or promise-like\n   - Show the original phrase and the revised, more balanced version\n\n3. Append a brief “Disclosure” paragraph appropriate for {jurisdiction}, {product_types}, and typical carrier expectations, based on the input {carrier_requirements}.
