            <!-- What is Term Life -->
            <div class="edu-section">
                <h2>What is Term Life Insurance?</h2>
                <p>Term life insurance is the most affordable type of life insurance available to Pennsylvania families. It provides a death benefit for a specific period (10, 20, or 30 years) at a fixed monthly rate.</p>
                
                <h3>How Term Life Works in Pennsylvania</h3>
                <p>When you purchase term life insurance in PA:</p>
                <ul class="edu-list">
                    <li><strong>You choose your coverage amount</strong> - Typically $100,000 to $1 million or more</li>
                    <li><strong>You select your term length</strong> - 10, 15, 20, or 30 years</li>
                    <li><strong>Your rate is locked in</strong> - Your monthly premium stays the same for the entire term</li>
                    <li><strong>If you pass away during the term</strong> - Your beneficiaries receive the full death benefit tax-free</li>
                    <li><strong>If you outlive the term</strong> - Coverage ends, but you've protected your family during critical years</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h2>How Much Does Term Life Insurance Cost in Pennsylvania?</h2>
                <p>Term life is remarkably affordable for Pennsylvania residents. Here are real-world examples:</p>
                
                <div class="cost-table">
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Age</th>

                <h3>Why Term Life is Cheaper Than Permanent Life Insurance</h3>
                <p>Term life costs 5-10 times less than whole life or universal life because:</p>
                <ul class="edu-list">
                    <li>No cash value accumulation - you're paying purely for protection</li>
                    <li>Coverage is temporary - most term policies end before a death claim is paid</li>
                    <li>Simple underwriting - faster and easier approval process</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h3>The "10X Income" Rule</h3>
                <p>A common guideline is to purchase 10 times your annual income. For example:</p>
                <ul class="edu-list">
                    <li>$50,000/year income → $500,000 coverage</li>
                    <li>$75,000/year income → $750,000 coverage</li>
                    <li>$100,000/year income → $1,000,000 coverage</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>The "DIME" Method (More Accurate)</h3>
                <p>Add up your family's needs:</p>
                <ul class="edu-list">
                    <li><strong>D</strong>ebt: Mortgage balance + car loans + credit cards + student loans</li>
                    <li><strong>I</strong>ncome: Annual income × years until kids are independent (usually 5-20 years)</li>
                    <li><strong>M</strong>ortgage: Total remaining mortgage balance</li>
                    <li><strong>E</strong>ducation: College costs for each child ($100k-$200k per child)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Example for a Schuylkill County Family:</strong></p>
                <ul class="edu-list">
                    <li>Mortgage: $150,000</li>
                    <li>Other Debt: $30,000</li>
                    <li>Income Replacement: $60,000 × 15 years = $900,000</li>
                    <li>College (2 kids): $200,000</li>
                    <li><strong>Total Needed: $1,280,000</strong></li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>This family should purchase at least <strong>$1.5 million in term life insurance</strong> - which would cost approximately $85/month for a healthy 35-year-old.</p>

            <!-- Common Questions -->
            <div class="edu-section">
                <h2>Common Questions from Pennsylvania Residents</h2>
                
                <h3>Can I get term life insurance with pre-existing conditions?</h3>
                <p>Yes! Many Pennsylvania residents with controlled conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol can still get term life insurance. You may pay slightly higher rates, but coverage is usually available. Conditions that are well-managed with medication typically qualify for standard or near-standard rates.</p>
                
                <h3>What happens when my term ends?</h3>
                <p>You have several options when your Pennsylvania term policy expires:</p>
                <ul class="edu-list">
                    <li><strong>Let it lapse</strong> - If you no longer need coverage (kids are grown, mortgage is paid, retirement savings are sufficient)</li>
                    <li><strong>Convert to permanent insurance</strong> - Most term policies include a conversion option that lets you switch to whole life or universal life without a medical exam</li>
                    <li><strong>Renew the term</strong> - Some policies allow renewal, but premiums increase significantly based on your current age</li>
                    <li><strong>Purchase a new term policy</strong> - If you're still in good health, you can apply for a new term at current rates</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Is term life insurance taxable in Pennsylvania?</h3>
                <p>No. Death benefits from life insurance are federally tax-free and also exempt from Pennsylvania state income tax. Your beneficiaries receive the full death benefit with no taxes owed.</p>
                
                <h3>How long does it take to get approved?</h3>
                <p>Pennsylvania residents can get approved:</p>
                <ul class="edu-list">
                    <li><strong>Instant Issue (No Exam):</strong> 10 minutes to 24 hours</li>
                    <li><strong>Simplified Issue:</strong> 2-7 days (brief health questions, sometimes phone interview)</li>
                    <li><strong>Fully Underwritten:</strong> 2-6 weeks (medical exam, full underwriting review)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Can I have multiple term life policies?</h3>
                <p>Yes! Many Pennsylvania families "ladder" their coverage by purchasing multiple term policies:</p>
                <ul class="edu-list">
                    <li>Example: $500k for 20 years + $500k for 10 years = $1M initial coverage that drops to $500k after 10 years when expenses decrease</li>
                    <li>Saves money by reducing coverage as you age and build assets</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Independent Agent = More Options</h3>
                <p>I work with multiple A-rated carriers, which means:</p>
                <ul class="edu-list">
                    <li>I shop your case with 10+ insurance companies</li>
                    <li>You get the best rate available for your health profile</li>
                    <li>I'm not limited to one company's rates or underwriting</li>
                    <li>I can find specialized coverage for unique situations</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>No Cost to You</h3>
                <p>Insurance agents are paid by the insurance company, not by you. You pay the same price whether you:</p>
                <ul class="edu-list">
                    <li>Buy direct from an insurance company</li>
                    <li>Work with a captive agent (works for one company)</li>
                    <li>Work with an independent agent like me (shops multiple companies)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The difference:</strong> I get you multiple quotes and personalized guidance at no extra cost.</p>
