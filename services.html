                <h2>1. Tax-Advantaged Wealth Accumulation</h2>
                <p>Our wealth accumulation strategies leverage Indexed Universal Life (IUL) policies, Roth conversions and Fixed Index Annuities to capture market growth while protecting principal with a <strong>0&nbsp;% floor</strong>. These vehicles offer tax-deferred or tax-free growth, annual resets that lock in gains, and access to cash value for retirement income or unexpected opportunities.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="service-detail">
                <h2>2. Asset Protection & Qualified Plan Rollovers</h2>
                <p>We help you shield your assets through permanent insurance and annuity structures that safeguard retirement savings from market downturns. Our team guides rollovers of 401(k), 403(b) and pension plans into products that provide guarantees, liquidity and living benefits for chronic or critical illness, as well as key-person and buy–sell funding for business owners.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="service-detail">
                <h2>3. College Education Funding Strategies</h2>
                <p>Traditional 529 plans aren’t your only option. We design flexible education funding strategies using IULs and other vehicles that accumulate tax-free cash value, can be used for any purpose, and still grow even when funds are borrowed for college. Parents maintain full control and can redirect funds if plans change.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="service-detail">
                <h2>4. Debt Management & Consolidation</h2>
                <p>Debt is the enemy of legacy building. Our “Debt‑Free Life” system uses cash value life insurance to recapture interest you’re paying to banks. By restructuring high‑interest debt and using policy loans at lower rates, you can eliminate debt faster, free up cash flow and grow savings at the same time.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="service-detail">
                <h2>5. Life Insurance, Living Benefits & Final Expense</h2>
                <p>From affordable term insurance with living benefits to whole life and universal life policies that build cash value, we offer solutions for every stage of life. Our plans provide income replacement, critical and chronic illness coverage, and guaranteed issue options for those with health challenges, plus final expense policies to cover burial costs.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="service-detail">
                <h2>6. Estate & Legacy Planning</h2>
                <p>We work with attorneys and accountants to create wills, trusts and buy–sell agreements, using life insurance to provide liquidity for estate taxes, equalize inheritances and ensure business continuity. Our legacy planning services aim to preserve family wealth across generations.</p>

            <div class="service-detail">
                <h2>7. Indexed Growth Strategies</h2>
                <p>Indexed products like IULs and Fixed Index Annuities provide a powerful blend of growth potential and protection. Your cash value is linked to market indexes with caps and participation rates, but never falls below a <strong>0&nbsp;% floor</strong>. Annual resets lock in gains while shielding you from market downturns.</p>

            <div class="service-detail">
                <h2>8. Mortgage Protection</h2>
                <p>Mortgage protection insurance pays off or reduces your mortgage balance if you die, become disabled or suffer a critical illness. These policies ensure your family can stay in their home during difficult times.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="service-detail">
                <h2>9. Business Owner & Key-Person Strategies</h2>
                <p>Business owners rely on our key‑person coverage, executive bonus plans and buy‑sell agreement funding to protect their companies from the loss of a vital partner or employee, reward top talent and assure smooth ownership transitions. We also design group life and retirement plans for small to mid‑sized organizations.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="service-detail">
                <h2>10. Retirement Income & Annuity Strategies</h2>
                <p>Our retirement strategies focus on safe‑money solutions such as lifetime income annuities and fixed index annuities that guarantee income you can’t outlive. These vehicles protect your principal, provide steady payments, and help create a secure retirement without worrying about market volatility.</p>
