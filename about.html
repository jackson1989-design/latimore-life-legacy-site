                    <div class="story-text-main">
                        <p>During a college basketball game, my heart stopped. I went into sudden cardiac arrest on the court at ESU's Koehler Fieldhouse. I was 22 years old.</p>
                        
                        <p>I survived because two athletic trainers, Wendy Dietrich and Colleen Shotwell, along with EMT Douglas Shaffer, had immediate access to an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). They shocked my heart back to life and administered CPR until the ambulance arrived.</p>
                        
                        <p>That AED was there because of the Gregory W. Moyer Defibrillator Fund - a nonprofit created after Greg Moyer, a 15-year-old Notre Dame basketball player, died of sudden cardiac arrest in 2000. His family's advocacy placed AEDs in schools and public buildings throughout Monroe County, including ESU.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Their preparation saved my life.</strong></p>

                    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                    <p>That experience taught me that preparedness is everything. Financial protection isn't about selling policies - it's about ensuring families have what they need when the unexpected happens.</p>
                    
                    <p>Today, I have three children. I coach youth sports in the same Pennsylvania counties where I grew up. And I help families build financial safety nets so they're prepared when life throws its worst at them.</p>

                <h2>My Mission</h2>
                <p>Latimore Life & Legacy exists to help families prepare financially, just as that AED prepared the gym to save my life. I work with working families, professionals, and business owners across Schuylkill, Luzerne, and Northumberland Counties.</p>
                
                <p>I bring the analytical skills of my MBA training, the public service mindset from my MPA, and the lived experience of someone who knows vulnerability isn't theoretical.</p>
