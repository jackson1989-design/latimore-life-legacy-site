    <p>

<!-- ================= IUL OVERVIEW ================= -->
<section class="section light">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Indexed Universal Life (IUL) — General Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Indexed Universal Life insurance is a form of permanent life insurance that
      provides a death benefit along with the potential to accumulate cash value.
      Cash value growth is linked to a market index, subject to caps, participation
      rates, and policy charges.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Permanent death benefit protection</li>
      <li>Flexible premium options (subject to policy requirements)</li>
      <li>Potential for tax-deferred cash value growth*</li>
      <li>Policy loans and withdrawals may be available*</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="disclaimer">
      *Policy loans and withdrawals may reduce policy values and death benefit.
      Tax treatment depends on individual circumstances.

<!-- ================= KEY PERSON ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Key Person Life Insurance</h2>
    <p>
      Key Person insurance is designed to help protect a business against the
      financial loss that may occur if a critical employee, owner, or executive
      passes away or becomes disabled.
    </p>

    <h3>Common Uses</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cover lost revenue or operational disruption</li>
      <li>Offset recruitment and training costs</li>
      <li>Support credit obligations or investor confidence</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Typically, the business owns the policy, pays the premiums, and is the
      beneficiary.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- ================= BUY-SELL ================= -->
<section class="section light">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Buy-Sell Agreements Funded with Life Insurance</h2>
    <p>
      A buy-sell agreement outlines how ownership interests may be transferred
      upon death, disability, or retirement of an owner. Life insurance is often
      used to help fund these agreements.
    </p>

    <h3>Common Structures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Entity (stock redemption) agreements</li>
      <li>Cross-purchase agreements</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Properly structured buy-sell planning can help ensure business continuity
      and liquidity during ownership transitions.
